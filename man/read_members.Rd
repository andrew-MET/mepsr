\title{Read ensemble members from a forecast file}
\usage{
read_members(model_files, parameter, members = seq(0, 9),
  file_type = NULL, lead_time = NULL, progress_bar = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_files}{Files to read. For NetCDF only 1 file is expected, but for
grib a vector of files can be passed. The character string 'mbr' must be
somewhere in the paths for the member numbes to be identified. It is
assumed that grib files only contain one member. For grib2 (yet to be
implemented) this might not be the case.}

\item{parameter}{The parameter to read.}

\item{members}{A vector of numbers identifying the members to read. This is
ignored for grib files as it is assumed that the members were already
decided when the filenames were obtained.}

\item{file_type}{The forecast file format. The function can attempt to
ascertain the format from the file name, but if it can't \code{file_type}
must be passed as an argument.}

\item{lead_time}{The lead time to read.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to \code{read_netcf} or \code{read_grib}}
}
\value{
A list containing: \cr \code{model_data}: The 3d field (the 3rd
  dimension is ensemble member). \cr \code{x}: The x coordinates in
  the projection of the forecast file. \cr \code{y}: The y coordinates
  in the projection of the forecast file. \cr \code{proj4_string}: The
  proj4 projection string for the forecast file. \cr \code{parameter}:
  The parameter that the 3d field represents. \cr \code{filename}: The
  full path to the forecast files.
}
\description{
\code{read_members} reads all esemble members from a forecast file for a
single lead time. It is possible to read from grib or netcdf files via the
helper functions. It is assumed that grib files only contain one member and
ntcdf files contain all members.
